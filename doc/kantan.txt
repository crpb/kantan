kantan - simple test suite for autotesting software using Grml and KVM

[[synopsis]]
Synopsis
--------

For the server (main) instance:

  kantan server <disk.img> <grml.iso> </mnt/point/of/iso/> [kvm_arguments]

or for client(s):

  kantan client <disk.img> <name> [kvm_arguments]

For further details please see section <<options>> and <<setup>>.

[[options]]
Options
-------

Options for _kantan server_:

 <disk.img> <grml.iso> </mnt/point/of/iso/> [kvm_arguments]

where _disk.img_ is an existing image file (created e.g. via 'qemu-img create
disk.img 3G'), grml.iso is an a Grml ISO (http://grml.org/),
/mnt/point/of/iso/ refers to the mount point where the specified Grml ISO is
mounted to (e.g. 'mount -o loop grml-medium_sid_latest.iso /mnt/test') and
_kvm_arguments_ are optional and can be used to add additional arguments to the
KVM commandline, like 'vga=791'.

[TIP]
The </mnt/point/of/iso/> doesn't necessarily need to be a real mountpoint.
It's fine if you just copy linux26 and initrd.gz from /boot/* of the Grml
ISO to </path/to/foobar/boot/> and specify </path/to/foobar/> as mountpoint
directory then.

Options for _kantan client_:

 <disk.img> <name> [kvm_arguments]

where _disk.img_ is an existing image file (created e.g. via 'qemu-img create
disk.img 3G'), _name_ assigns the virtual instance a name (for reading
/etc/kantan/name.cfg iff the file exists). The _kvm_arguments_ are optional and
can be used to add additional arguments to the KVM commandline, like '-boot d'
for booting from the ISO.

Description

image:kantan-screenshot.jpg[link="kantan-screenshot.png"]

Kantan is a set of scripts to automatically test software using KVM
(http://www.linux-kvm.org/) and the Debian based Linux live system Grml
(http://grml.org/). You don't have to set up neither tons of software packages
nor a complex environment but just follow some simple <<setup,setup
instructions>>.

It was originally developed to provide a simple way for autotesting specific
versions of FAI (http://fai-project.org/) but is expected to provide a
simple-to-use test suite for autotesting any Linux based software.

The concept of Kantan is to boot one virtual machine (the main instance, 'kantan
server ...') which is supposed to be able to serve as installation server for
further virtual machines if needed. This concept for example allows to
automatically set up a link:http://fai-project.org/[FAI] server which then
deploys further started virtual machines (the clients, 'kantan client ...').

Kantan is meant to be a prototype implementation to show how automated testing
could be realised. In the long run the author would like to get a suite to
automatically test:

* complete Debian installations

* testing Debian packages within current state of Debian suites

* software configurations that are required to run on more than one host
(installation procedures with dependencies between different systems during
installation, cluster + HA setups,...)

* live systems with their flexible boot options, specific features and services

* kernel versions

* software packages that provide unit tests

* low-level tools like partitioning, LVM, mdadm,...

* filesystems (crash, repair, mount,...)

[CAUTION]
This software is WIP, though released in an early stage to gain feedback,
testers and developers. It's a prototype implementation mainly in shellscript
but is expected to be rewritten in a real scripting language like python.

[[requirements]]
Requirements
------------

What you need to be able to use Kantan:

* a Debian (based) system (any other Linux system might do it as well, but
  the scripts and docs are optimised for Debian (based) systems for now)

* a system running i386 or amd64 architecture (to smoothly use KVM)

* at least 2GB of RAM are recommended

* at least 4GB of harddisk space for >=2 virtual disk images

* a Grml ISO (see instructions below)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
* a network bridge with a DHCP server and dnsmasq listening on it (see
instructions for setup as follows)

As network configuration Kantan assumes you've a working bridge setup with
interface _vnet_ using two tap devices _tap0_ (for the kantan server) and _tap1_
(and optionally further tap devices - all of them for the kantan clients).
Configuration example for /etc/network/interfaces (replace $USER with _your_
username under which you want to execute the kantan script then):

  # example config for /etc/network/interfaces
  iface vnet inet static
        post-up tunctl -u $USER -g $USER -t tap0 ; brctl addif vnet tap0 ; ip link set up dev tap0
        post-up tunctl -u $USER -g $USER -t tap1 ; brctl addif vnet tap1 ; ip link set up dev tap1
        pre-down ip link set down dev tap0 ; tunctl -d tap0
        pre-down ip link set down dev tap1 ; tunctl -d tap1
        bridge_ports none
        address 192.168.10.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0

Install dnsmasq to forward DNS requests from KVM guests to physical net:

  # apt-get install dnsmasq

The relevant dhcpd configuration to serve the FAI server VM with a IPv4
configuration but ignore some further client machines that will be booted via
PXE (kantan client) later on:

  # tail /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf
  subnet 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.10.50 192.168.10.200;
    option routers 192.168.10.1;
    option domain-name-servers 192.168.10.1;
    next-server 192.168.10.1;
    filename "pxelinux.0";
  }
  host ignore0 {hardware ethernet 00:1d:92:ab:3f:80;ignore booting;}
  host ignore1 {hardware ethernet 00:1d:92:ab:3f:81;ignore booting;}
  host ignore2 {hardware ethernet 00:1d:92:ab:3f:82;ignore booting;}

# for users of Grml it's even simplier :)
auto vnet
iface vnet inet static
      post-up  /usr/sbin/grml-vnet -u $USER -b vnet    tap0 tap1 tap2 tap3
      pre-down /usr/sbin/grml-vnet -u $USER -b vnet -d tap0 tap1 tap2 tap3
      bridge_ports none
      address 192.168.10.1
      netmask 255.255.255.0

# ifup vnet

Make sure the network interfaces inside the VM's have access to the internet
then:

  # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
  # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

[[setup]]
Setup and Usage Instructions
----------------------------

Install the kantan Debian package, which for now is available from
http://people.debian.org/~mika/kantan/

Grab a Grml ISO and mount it somewhere:

  % wget download.grml.org/grml64-medium_2010.04.iso
  % wget download.grml.org/grml64-medium_2010.04.iso.md5
  % md5sum -c grml64-medium_2010.04.iso.md5
  % sudo mount -o loop grml64-medium_2010.04.iso /mnt/test

If necessary adjust /etc/kantan/server.cfg according to your needs.

Create image files for use as /srv within FAI server and as harddisk for the FAI
client (qemu-img is available from qemu-utils):

  % qemu-img create fai-server.img 3G
  % qemu-img create fai-client.img 3G

If you want to provide any local Debian packages to the FAI server instance
(like for example a specific version of FAI you'd like to test) just create the
directory _debs_ in the current working directory (being the one where you'll
invoke kantan later on), like for example:

  % mkdir debs
  % dget -u -d http://fai-project.org/download/squeeze/fai_3.4.4_amd64.changes
  % mv fai*.deb debs/

Finally execute the kantan script as $USER for the server instance, providing
the path to the generated image file, the Grml-ISO and the mountpoint where the
Grml ISO is mounted on:

  % kantan server fai-server.img grml64-medium_2010.04.iso /mnt/test

Finally start the FAI client instance (the one that should be installed by the
kantan server VM), specifying _grml_ as client name (so /etc/kantan/grml.cfg
would be read if it exists) and "-boot d" as boot option for KVM so it uses the
PXE ISO for booting (just drop "-boot d" then when installation of client has
finished):

  % kantan client fai-client.img grml "-boot d"

That's it! :) Further usage scenarious and tests will follow.

FAQ

[[why_kantan]]
Why Kantan?
~~~~~~~~~~~

The author of Kantan thinks that lack of proper Q/A is one of the most annoying
issues in the open source world. So let's do something against that.

[[what_does_kantan_mean]]
What does Kantan mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The author of Kantan is a friend of the
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban[Kanban] concept and created the word
Kantan based on "the Kanban of testing".  Amusingly according to
http://www.cjvlang.com/Writing/writjpn/signs/kantan.html "Kantan is a
Chinese-style compound (on-reading) meaning 'simple'." which represents the idea
of Kantan: provide a _simple_ method for testing software.

[[kantan_vs_chroot]]
Why use a VM and not just a chroot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chroots provide a nice way for testing stuff like package installations. But
they are limited to some restricted actions. Chroots don't properly support
testing kernel versions, bootoptions, partitioning tools, LVM, mdadm,... in a
reasonable environment.

[[external_system]]
How can I use Kantan with physical machines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Kantan uses vde_switch for network configuration. This provides a
working network setup between the server and the client(s) machines without
having to configure anything. But if you want to use external, physical machines
this does not work any longer.  Instead just set up tap devices so you can
install clients on real[tm] hardware.

Assume the following setup: the Kantan server is the server where you're executing
"kantan server ...". The test client is the machine where you want to boot
the system which would be corresponding to "kantan client ..." (but instead of
executing "kantan client ..." as virtual guest you're running it on physical
machine). NIC eth0 is providing internet access (WAN). NIC eth1 is the network
link between the server and the client machine.

  +----------------+
  | Kantan   ,-----|----- eth0 ----- [ Internet/WAN ]
  | Server   |     |
  |        [tap1]  |
  |          |     |
  |          `-----|----- eth1 ----- [ Test client ]
  +----------------+

Then the following configuration should do the trick for you:

  # example config for /etc/network/interfaces
  iface vnet inet static
        post-up tunctl -u grml -g grml -t tap1 ; brctl addif vnet tap1 ; ip link set up dev tap1
        post-up brctl addif vnet eth1
        pre-down ip link set down dev tap1 ; tunctl -d tap1
        bridge_ports none
        address 192.168.10.2
        netmask 255.255.255.0

Configure /etc/kantan/server.cfg:

  VLAN1_DEVICE='tap1'

Then execute:

  ifup vnet
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE


To forward DNS requests from the clients to the physical net use dnsmasq:

  /etc/init.d/dnsmasq start || apt-get install dnsmasq
