Kantan is a set of scripts to automatically test software using KVM
(http://www.linux-kvm.org/) and the Debian based Linux live system Grml
(http://grml.org/). You don’t have to set up neither tons of software packages
nor a complex environment but just follow some simple setup instructions.

The concept of Kantan is to boot one virtual machine (the main instance, kantan
server …) which is supposed to be able to serve as installation server for
further virtual machines, if needed. This concept for example allows to
automatically set up a FAI server which then deploys further virtual machines
(the clients, kantan client …).

If you don't need this server<->client architecture you can of course use the
server instance as standalone service. This allows usage of kantan within a
continous integration suite like Jenkins.
